# Homework 7

You have one week to complete these three problems. Some of are modified versions of the exercises at the end of Chapter 6 in the book, others are of my own design. Complete them to the best of your ability and then submit them. Make sure your code works (compiles, runs, and passes the initial checks) before you submit it. You can always resubmit up until the deadline, but you will not receive any credit if your code does not run.

## Skills

This homework covers skills 3.1, 3.4, 3.7. You will most likely have to rely on previously learned to complete the problems, but the bulk of the work will practice these skills.

## As always...
Make sure that you include your first and last name in the comment section at the very beginning of the Java file; if I cannot determine whose homework this is, I cannot give you credit.
